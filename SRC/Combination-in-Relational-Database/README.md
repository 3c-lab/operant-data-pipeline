# Combination in Relational Database

This project demonstrates how to handle combinations in a relational database context.

## Problem Description

Given a table `Combinations` with two columns:
- `user_id`: The ID of the user
- `combination`: A string representing a combination

The goal is to find all valid combinations that meet certain criteria.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses SQL queries to:
1. Filter combinations based on specific conditions
2. Group and aggregate data as needed
3. Handle edge cases appropriately
