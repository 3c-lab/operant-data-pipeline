    Have to include exit tab sheet in the excel file. The change will be to get both of those sheets separately to then join them together
    but exclude duplicate columns. Even if this is taken care of by pandas join, we will exclude the RAT id as that already exists in the
    subject table. Also, there may be mismatch errors between the timeline and exit tab sheet. Will also exclude cohort

    - Filter out RAT id from exit tab to join
    - Filter out cohort
        - Modify the existing rat information sheets to include cohort number
